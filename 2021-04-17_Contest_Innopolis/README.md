### Six simple problems from Innopolis Contest on April 17th 2021.
All problems are written in *pdf*-document.
Solutions are written in Python. There are tests in every file (function _def test()_).

*A , B, C, D* are **accepted** (correct)

*E* **failed** on test #25 . I did not guess the issue, but 24 tests have been passed anyway.

*F* have been written after contest. Probably it's correct. At least it passes three basic examples.
